Hi!

This is the BatchRenamer script revised to not add leading zeros. For example, if you batch rename your layers, S22 - S1, S09 will now be S9. 

Replace your current BatchRenamer(Adobe>Adobe Illustrator 20XX>Presets>en_us>Scripts) with this code or rename it to have a variant. Happy Illustrating!
